## Overview

**Chilete DevPath** is a **personal and educational project** where I document—clearly, honestly, and progressively—  
**my real journey in learning and building software systems**.

This is **not** a traditional portfolio.  
It is **not** a collection of polished or isolated demos.

It is a **living, documented process**, built from solid fundamentals,  
guided by technical judgment, and refined through continuous improvement.

> Foundations first. Construction follows.

## 👨‍💻 About the author

My name is **Adrian Pisco**, proudly Peruvian 🇵🇪, from **Chilete – Cajamarca**,  
and a **Systems and Computer Engineering** student.

My approach to software development prioritizes **understanding over accumulation**.  
Rather than chasing tools, frameworks, or trends, I focus on the principles that allow systems to be:

- coherent
- maintainable
- well-structured
- technically reasoned

I advance through consistency, discipline, and critical thinking,  
treating mistakes as an essential part of real engineering growth.

My greatest personal motivation is **my mother**,  
who taught me the value of effort, perseverance, and discipline  
as the foundation of any meaningful path.

## 🧭 What is Chilete DevPath?

**Chilete DevPath is a documented journey.**

It represents my real growth process as a software developer,  
expressed through two complementary pillars:

- 🌐 **A personal website**, where I present my identity,  
  projects, technical decisions, and professional evolution.
- 📚 **A learning record**, where I document how I think,  
  how I design systems, how I fail, how I correct, and how I improve.

This project does **not** prioritize speed or appearances.  
It prioritizes **understanding**, **judgment**, and **long-term progress**.

## 🧱 Guiding principles

Chilete DevPath is built on clear engineering principles:

- Fundamentals before frameworks
- Logical reasoning before copying solutions
- Architecture before disorganized code
- Process before final results
- Continuous improvement as a discipline

The path is **not linear**.  
Learning, failure, correction, and improvement are iterative and intentional.

## 🌱 Community and shared learning

Chilete DevPath aims to be a **shared learning space**.

A place to show real development processes:

- without competition
- without pretense
- without shortcuts

If you are building your own path in software development,  
you are welcome here.
